# dumb-html-css-js
Dumb example site for testing, learning and messing around with html, css and javascript.

Some examples and/or exercises are taken or modified from [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net) by Marijn Haverbeke, some from [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), some from [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), and lots just nonsense.
