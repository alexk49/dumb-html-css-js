    <h2>Formating Text</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes we need to format text in a particular way. Some words need to
      be <strong>bold</strong> which uses a strong tag. And, sometimes you might
      need to emphasise something with <em>Italics</em> which uses the em tag.
      And once, in a while you might want to <span>underline</span> something
      which uses the span tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The p tags does naturally make a line break but sometimes we want
      something more...
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>An extra br / tag adds a new line or a line break.</p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you might want proper emphasis though on your break in which
      case maybe try the hr tag.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>This gives a pretty cool proper line break.</p>
    <p>
      And now, let me give you a quote. Taken from the html cheat page:
      <q>Success is a journal not a destination.</q>
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://ruwix.com/">
      The Rubik's Cube is the World's best selilng puzzle toy.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You might want to use a block quote to indent a longer quote in a piece of
      prose.
