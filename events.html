    <h1>Events</h1>
    <p>Generally, Event listeners are the preferred method for setting events but there are multiple ways to do it.</p> 
    <p>Uses embedded js in html file:</p>
    <button onclick="alert('hello world')">Click Me</button>
    <p>Separate js file, that uses the ID tag to get the selector and the onclick selector in the js file. This is not ideal as a DOM element can only have one "onclick property</p>
    <button id="btn">No, click me!!!!</button>
    <p>Uses event listener in separate file:</p>
    <button id="eventBtn">nooo, click me!!</button>
    <p>All the above can also use named functions as shown below. This one also includes logging information about the event triggered:</p>
    <button id="functionBtn">click me if you want</button>
    <p>and here is a list of buttons</p>
    <div id="container">
        <button id="1">Click Me</button>
        <button id="2">Click Me</button>
        <button id="3">Click Me</button>
    </div>
</body>
