        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Hello, I have made this webpage to follow the specifications of the CS50 week 8 problem set titled "Homepage". 
        <p>A lot of websites can be quite difficult to look through using dev tools as a beginner. So, I've put this together with the intention of having easy to read demonstration of different html tags and styles in use.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy looking around.</p>
        <h3>Getting around</h3>
        <p>The below demonstrates the ul tags, which is an unordered list. Each item in the list contains a link to the four other secondary pages that were requested for this problem set</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="page-one.html">Page one</a></li>
            <li><a href="page-two.html">Page two</li>
            <li><a href="page-three.html">Page three</li>
            <li><a href="page-four.html">Page four</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
